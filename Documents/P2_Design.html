    <h1>P2 Project Requirements</h1>
    <h2>Lena, Signe, Kaja, Mathias & Ingvild</h2>
    <p>October 07, 2022</p>
    <div>
      <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
      <p>Client name: Fru Svendsen Kunst og Kulturkafé</p>
      <p>webpage name: Fru Svendsen Kunst og Kulturkafé</p>
      <p>Contact Person: Monika</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
      <p>
        The website's purpose is to reach out to possible new customers for the
        cafe, and also to give information to existing customers. In addition to
        information about the cafe we want to show menu, map with location and
        possibilities like events and renting the cafe. We also want to give the
        customers information about the history behind the cafe as well as
        pictures and gallery. The audience is everyone interested in the cafe,
        but we assume the main audience will be younger people and tourists.
        This is based on the fact that more young people use websites.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The navigation structure of the webpage of Fru Svendsen is shown in the
        figure below. It can be described as a clique, which means you can
        access all pages from every page. This is possible because we will have
        a navigation bar that allows us to access them all.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Page Layout and Apperance</h2>
      <p>
        After speaking with the owner of Fru Svendsen, we have decided to create
        an open, clean webpage with easy access to finding the most important
        things the cafe offers. We have focused on displaying the menu as early
        as possible, because most people that visits the page, would benefit
        from finding out what kind of food and drinks the cafe offers. We have
        also included the opening hours in the footer to make it easy to find
        out when the cafe is open.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages can be
        found below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Font: "Lucette" for the main title (36pt) and navigation bar (18pt),
          and “Inter” for the body (16pt)
        </li>
        <li>Color Scheme:</li>
        <li>Text: Raisin Black #231F20</li>
        <li>Background: Warm White #FFFDFB</li>
        <li>Footer: Raisin Black #231F20</li>
        <li>Grafic elements and user interface components: Ochre #CC7722</li>
        <li>
          Shadows: the information element on the slideshow will be displayed
          with a shallow black shadow, to highlight the element. X: 6, Y:6,
          spread: 6, Blur: 40. Color: Raisin Black #231F20 7%.
        </li>
        <li>Borders: solid raisin black 0.5</li>
        <li>Body width: 1200px;</li>
        <li>
          Links: The logo on the top of the navbar will be a clickable link
          which will bring users back to the home page.
        </li>
        <li>
          The menu sections will have drop-down menus that can be clicked and
          contain links to the respective pages. Navbar position and apperance:
          The nabber will be included at the top of the page to make it
          accessible. When hovering over the different tabs within the navbar,
          the dash (with the color: #CC7722), will move to the corresponding nav
          element.
        </li>
        <li>
          Banner: We do not have a banner, but a slideshow on the "forside".
        </li>
        <li>
          Slideshow: We have a slideshow on the "forside" since we have a lot of
          pages on the website, and will give a introduction on what you can do
          on the differnt webpages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Footer: Opening hours, social media, cat illustration and a google map
        </li>
        <li>
          Images: All of our images is in "blob" format, with the exeption of:
          "bilder" and "kunstgalleri" where the images are squared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Illustrations: We have some illustration of cats and coffe cups. The
          cats will be a fun element who tell something about the webpages. E.g.
          dancing cats on "Utleie", and a cat in a coffe cup on the "meny".
        </li>
        <li>
          Logo: Our logo will be located in center over the navbar. They do
          already have an logo, but it is old and outdated, so we will make a
          new one. I think we will have one logo of the house with the name "Fru
          Svendsen" under. And another with just the house.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Content</h2>

      <p>There will be eigth separate pages as follows:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Forside - forside.html
          <br />
          The "forside" is the first page that the user will see on the webiste.
          The user gets an overview of the site with a slidshow (javascript)
          that contain information about the most important webpages, such as
          "meny", "arrangement" and "utleie". When the user continues to scroll
          down he/she will see some text and images that wishes the user
          welcome, and a button "les mer" where you can read more about their
          history. On the bottom there is a footer.

        </li>
        <li>
          Meny
          <br />
          At the "meny" page you can find out what the cafe is serving. We will
          maybe make the meny into a exel-sheet so the owners of Fru Svendsen
          can update the meny if needed. Here is also some picture of delicious
          food.
          <img src="Images/meny.jpg" alt="meny" />
        </li>

        <li>

          describes the arrengment will be at the left, and date and time is
          over the picture to the lefe. Some text that describes the arrengment

          This page is mainly a form for getting in contact with Fru Svendsen
          about renting the café for private events. First there is a short
          introduction about renting the venue. Then there is 4 single line text
          fields for first name, last name, e-mail and date. there is also a
          textarea where the user write a message about their wish to rent the

          goal of the page is to give the user a good overview of the café when

          <br />
          This page will showcase the different artist that are currently
          displaying and selling their art at Fru Svendsen Kunst og Kulturkafé.
          The user will be able to see what kind of artist they can expect when
          going to the cafe, but due to copyright infringement laws, we can't
          showcase the art.

          also include a picture of the staff on the right. We have also the

    <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
    <p>Kaja will be in charge of implementing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A Javascript function that will convert an Excel (or another file
        format) into html code, so that Fru Svendsen easily can update the menu
        without having to deal a lot with html code, but only need to update the
        excel file in the folder
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Lena will be in charge of implementing:</p>
    <ol>

    <p>Kaja and Lena will together be in charge of implementing:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>

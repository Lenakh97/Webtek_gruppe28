      <h2>Testing Document:</h2>
      <p> 
        We gave the test object some tasks while we observed how they interacted with the website. 
        When we articulated the questions and tasks for the testing, we tried to ask open-ended questions.
        In the tasks, we formulated the questions, trying to avoid using the exact words that are on the website,
        so that the test objects would have to understand the task instead of just finding the words on the web page.
        </p>
      <p>Tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is your first impression of the website??</li>
        <li>Can you tell us something about Fru Svendsen?</li>
        <li>Is it possible to celabrate a wedding at Fru Svendsen?</li>
        <li>Do they have any vegetarian food?</li>
        <li>When closes the café on saturday?</li>
        <li>What is the location of Fru Svendsen?</li>
        <li>Can you find the phone number of Fru Svendsen?</li>
        <li>What do you think of the website?</li>
        <li>Anything that could be better?</li>
      <ul>

      <h2>Testing Audience:</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted a total of 6 user tests. We choose to only test on 6 people, as more tests will most likely result in 
        the same feedback (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/?fbclid=IwAR3j8pHjdcQDx6FfkPho2vNBQKfGcN3cNocYtKqcDXEWugQI21o4zmCtlNM)">Jacob Nilsen, 2020</a>).
        We tested the website on different customers segments, and recruited students and pensioners, as Fru Svendsen highlighted 
        those groups as their most important customers. We tested on 3 students and 3 pensioners, with 4 physical tests and 2 online tests.

      <h2>Testing Platforms:</h2>
      <p>
        4/6 test objects used Windows, while the rest used Mac. Most of our test objects chose to used Google Chrome as web browser, but they also 
        tried to use Safari, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. They all used the newest version of the browsers. If 
        we would do new test, we should have tried some older versions too. The website worked well in all the browser, 
        there was just minor differences.
    </p>

      <h2>Feedback Summary:</h2>
      <p>All of the test objects were positive to the design of the website. They also thought the navigation was intuitive, 
        and they had no problem navigating between the different pages. Some of them were first a bit confused with what the website was about, but they 
        did not use too much time to figure it out. They could easily find the content they were looking for and could always 
        answer our questions. Some of them commented that it was not possible to click on the logo to get back to the first 
        page, and wanted the logo to be a bit further down from the top. They also thought the allergies on the menu page should be showcased differently, because it was difficult to 
        find the allergies and remember which number corresponded to which allergy. Some of the test objects commentated on
        the lack of pictures of the Café. They didn't instintivly understand that it was a Café. The form on the “utleige”-page 
        also needed some improvements. Since the written language should be nynorsk, we also had to fix the spelling. 
        Despite this, the test objects were mostly positive. </p>

      <h2>Your Response:</h2>
      <p>We got a lot of feedback from the user test, and implemented some of the changes to the website before delivery. 
        One thing we did was making the logo clickable, and made sure that it worked as a navigation to the front page, as
         this is a standard on a lot of webpages. Another thing we fixed before the delivery was placing the logo a bit further down,
         to make it more accessible as a navigation button. We also tried to fix the errors in the 
        form, to make sure the user fills it out the right way. If we would have had more time we would have used icons for 
        allergies to make it more intuitive. Adding more images on the front page of the Café, might be something
        that could help people understand what Fru Svendsen offers both in terms of food, but also events and art.

      <h2>Self-Reflection:</h2>
      <p>
        From the project we have learned how developers think and the technology behind good web design.
        Some ideas look good in figma, but are difficult to implement using HTML, CSS and JS. This was especially true for us design students.
        Working interdisciplinary, where everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and being able to learn from each other has been a good experience. 
        We had some stagnation in the project, since our client was slow to respond, and we had to be creative with illustrations since the photos was in such poor quality. 
        GitHub was new for us designers, and is also something we have learn during this course.
        
        Being an interdisciplinary group, we also tried to divide tasks based on our strengths and weaknesses. This resulted in 
        some group members doing more work in the beginning, and some having to do more work towards the end. Maybe talking about
        this at the early stages in the project could have made the project less hectic towards the end.

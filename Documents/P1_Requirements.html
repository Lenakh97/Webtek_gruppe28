      <h2>Our client</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Client name: Fru Svendsen Kunst og Kulturkaf√©</li>
        <li>Contact Person: Monika</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our client, Monika, is the daily manages of the cafe and has been
        working at the cafe for a year. The cafe has been open for 20 years,
        before that is was used as a hotel. The house is from around 1860.
        Monika will send us more background info on the cafe on mail later for
        the website.

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the website is to give the cafe a more profeccional look,
        and to reach out to more visitors. They would like to reach out to
        international customers, mostly from Spain and Germany. But also
        students who are new in town. They also wanted to get a good overview
        over event that are happening in the future. Both big events like
        exhibitions and smaller thing like when they are open on sundays.
        Displaying contact info and menu was also important for them.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>
        She mostly has older customers, but also students and some
        internationals. She would like the website to be accessable and
        readable for all, so would be ideal to have the possibility to switch at
        least parts of the site to english. The older customers will most likely
        not use the website, so it will mainly be for younger customers under 60
        years. They will most likely use it for menu, contact info and actually
        finding the cafe.

              Want the "guloker" to be presented in the website. (hex code is
              #CC7722)
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not have a database, so it is not dependent on other services,
              making it faster to load.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trying to make the maintenance as small as posible since they do
              not have a lot experience with html/css.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    <div>
      <h2>Specific Preferences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fru Svendsen would like a minimalistic design, but also prefer their
          brandcolor on the webpage "guloker", which is the color on their
          house. (hex code is #CC7722)
        </li>
        <li>
          Fru svendsn have specifically told us that they would like to be able
          to modify the content of the website. Monika have used html code
          before (20 years since), but they can also pay us later if they need
          to update the website.
        </li>
        <li>
          They do also have some international custumers, so the menu should be
          in both norwegian and english. And they prefer that the international
          custumers can find the website, or at least the location of the cafe.
        </li>
        <li>
          They do also need a upgraded logo and visual profile. They want the
          house to be a part of the logo since it is their distinguishing mark.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Final Location</h2>
      <p>
        Monika will buy a domain for fru Svendsen, and will cover the hosting
        fees. Monika wants to take care of the website after we deliveres it,
        and make changes herself. We have offered to help if needed.

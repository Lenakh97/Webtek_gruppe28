			<h2>The changes we have made</h2>
			<h3>General changes</h3>
			<p>
				We changed all the pictures from being "blobs" back to normal square
				pictures, because the blob design isn't really optimized to Fru
				Svendsens customers. One of their main customer segments of the Café is
				pensioners, and showcasing bigger picture is considered a better design
				practice when designing for elderly people. A more old style design also
				fits the brand identity of Fru Svendsen better. Another reason we
				changed the pictures is the picture quailty. The ones we recived from
				our client was most likely taken with a phone which results in grainy
				pictures, so we made some illustration instead. The illustrations has
				been used troughout the website, and helps create a cohesive design. We
				also created a new logo, this was done in dialog with the client, and is
				just a more modern version of the old logo.
				<!--Legg til en setning om padding som er blitt lagt til på samtlige sider, og hvor mye dette evt er-->
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to forside.html</h3>
			<p>
				In order to visually differentiate between the various sections with
				elements and text, we changed the background color of the slideshow
				(#F5F1EC) and on the third section on the page (#FAEDDD). In the
				previous slideshow, we removed the box-shawdow. We also changed
				thickness (18px) and color (#231F20) of the navigation arrows in the
				slideshow, to make the navigation easier to use and see. We also added
				more text to the page, filling out the page with more information. We
				moved the first picture to the right.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to meny.html</h3>
			<p>
				On the meny.html page we removed the blob pictures, and created some
				illustrations that better fits the current design structure of the
				entire webpage. We have also changed the menu text and therefore the
				structure of the text, after receiving the menu from Fru Svendsen. The
				border has been removed, and the text is structed around the
				illustrations, either floating to the right or left of them. In addition
				we also included some information about allergies at the bottom of the
				page.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to arrangment.html</h3>
			<p>
				We implemented a button that takes you to the Facebook-event. A header
				was also added and what weekday the events are happening. We changed the
				lines between the events to black for more visibility.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to utleie.html:</h3>
			<p>
				On the utleie.html page we removed the picture and the cat illustration,
				to highlight the form instead. The mail function is implemented using
				html, so there is no javascript on the mail functionality.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to bilder.html</h3>
			<p>
				On the bilder.html page, we added more photos, and changed the padding.
				We chose to display 2 pictures on each row instead of 3 to make each
				picture bigger and more visible. All the pictures are taken by Fru
				Svendsen, and the sizing-pattern on the picture rows are; 3:2, 2:3, 3:2
				and so on.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to kunst.html</h3>
			<p>
				On the kunst.html page, we removed the cat figure, and instead of just
				showcasing the name of the artist, we also added a small description and
				an image of their art. The images we used are only placeholders, and are
				from unsplash (we are allowed to use the images per their copyright
				law).
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to historie.html</h3>
			<p>
				We choose to add a timeline, to visually structure the storytelling on
				the page. This makes it easier for the reader to get a quick impression
				of the history before they start reading. The pictures included have
				width: 430px, same as the paragraph. We changed the pictures to better
				fit the theme of the history page, the first picture is Svennsgården
				from the 19th century, the other one shows the Café today. On smaller
				devices, we remove the timeline and only include the text and images.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to kontaktOss.html</h3>
			<p>
				Under the kontakOss.html, we added informational text to make the page
				more friendly and fitting for the client. We removed the picture, and
				added a cat illustration instead. We also added lines between the
				e-post, telefon and adresse to make the page structure better and
				improve the readability of the page. We also made the e-post, telefon
				and adresse text into h3 elements to highlight them further.
			</p>
			<h3>Changes to footer</h3>
			<p>
				We removed the illustrations from the footer, and changed the color of
				the icons from #FFFDFB to #CC7722. The google-map is now in a black and
				white version and we placed it on the far right of the footer. In
				addition we included contact ut in the footer, and changed the opening
				hours text.
			</p>
			<h2>Changes to CSS styling</h2>
			<p>
				We also changed the font-family, H1 and H2 are now; Noe Display, and
				paragraphs are; Questa sans. All of the H1 titles are moved to the left.
				Background-color changed to #FFFDFB. Border on button changed from 0.7px
				to 1px, and the top layer (black rectangle) is no longer transparent.
			</p>
			<h2>readtextfromfile.js</h2>
			<p>
				This was removed as a script file, but the functionality is included in
				menu.html as a script. Not any changes done, other than more
				spesifically reads from excel files and not a file in general. The
				motives for having this script was originally so that the owners easily
				could change the menu, I should have included the title of each menu in
				the excel file and it should also have read this. but that can be an
				update before we hand the website over to them.
			</p>
			<h2>location.js</h2>
			<p>
				The functionality of this is still the same as we planned. There is done
				some changes in colors from what we originally was thinking. the map is
				basically added as explained
